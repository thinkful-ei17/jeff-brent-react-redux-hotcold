Requirements
All of the state which is currently contained in components should be moved into a Redux store.
The information from the store should be propagated to the components using React Redux's connect method.
Your app should have a single reducer which handles any actions which you need to make the app's functionality work.
The components should handle any user interaction by dispatching actions to the store.


Hints and tips
Try designing your state and connecting your components first.
Add some dummy data to make sure that you are propagating and displaying the data correctly.
Make a list of everything which a user can do in the game - these will become your actions.
Implement one feature at a time. You don't need to make starting a new game, making guesses, and displaying feedback all functional at once.
Remember to avoid mutating the state in your reducer.

ACTIONS:
make a guess
{
  type:MAKE_GUESS,
  number:32,
}

start new game
{
  type:NEW_GAME
}

React-Redux Implementation:
1. Set up provider in index.js X

Tackle each action with these steps:

2. Confirm which components need state passed in with connect
3. Propogate information into components with connect
4. Add dispatch action methods to components
  -First console.log value
  -Then log current value, etc.
  -Then dispatch value
